# Go City Full Stack Tech Test

Thank you for taking the time to interview with GoCity. Our commitment is to ensure we hire at the highest standards as well as ensuring that you understand what would be required within the role. This is why we ask you to complete a technical task as part of the process.

The aim of this task is to assess your problem solving approach and ability to write working code.

We are looking for production ready, pragmatic, testable and maintainable code.  We value readability over complexity.

Go City recognise work is just one part of your life so please don't spend your whole weekend or evening on this task.

## The Task
Create a small destinations management application that meets the following user story:

```
As a Destinations Manager
I want to be able to view the % of visits per attraction for a selected destination
sorted by % descending
```

We use Next.js and Java with Spring Boot at GoCity, depending on the level and focus you have applied for we will provide different initial scaffolding via github.  
The test has been designed for all applicants to have to look and/or make changes in the code of their opposite discipline.

We have included:
- A Next.js implementation of the [frontend](tech-test-frontend/README.md) 

Please build:
- Production ready code which solves the above user story. 

## Submission
